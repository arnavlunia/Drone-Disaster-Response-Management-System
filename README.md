This project is a full-stack **Drone Disaster Response Management System** that integrates a modern, responsive web-based frontend with a Node.js/Express backend and a MySQL relational database. The system is designed to simulate real-world emergency-response scenarios using drones, operators, mission reports, alerts, and disaster lifecycle management. The application provides a comprehensive dashboard that displays real-time analytics such as active disasters, mission progress, personnel availability, and fleet readiness. The frontend, built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript, features a clean interface with multiple sections for adding disasters, drones, operators, alerts, and mission reports. It also includes a dedicated panel for viewing detailed analytical SQL reports and a GUI module for resolving ongoing disasters, deleting disasters, and creating users.

On the backend, the system uses Express.js with MySQL2 (promise-based) to implement RESTful APIs that handle all CRUD operations. These include insertion endpoints for disasters, drones, operators, mission reports, and alerts; a resolving-endpoint to close active disasters; a delete operation; and dynamic loaders that populate dropdown menus. The backend also exposes endpoints for five advanced SQL analytical queries, involving joins, nested queries, filtering using HAVING clauses, and aggregate calculations. The architecture cleanly separates concerns by keeping all database operations asynchronous and ensuring that the frontend fetches data on-demand through these APIs.

The MySQL database is the backbone of the system, containing all major tables such as DISASTER, DRONE, ALERTS, DRONE_STATUS, OPERATOR, MISSION_REPORT, and more. To demonstrate strong DBMS concepts, the project includes a **trigger**, a **function**, and a **stored procedure**. The trigger automatically updates a drone’s flying hours whenever new telemetry data is inserted, the function dynamically classifies operators into skill levels (Novice, Intermediate, Senior, Expert), and the stored procedure resolves ongoing disasters by updating their End_Time. In addition to these, the system implements complex SQL queries that analyze mission performance, identify available operators, flag drones requiring maintenance, calculate total resources used, and categorize drones by payload tier.

Security and authenticity are demonstrated using **role-based access control**, where two MySQL users, `viewer_user` and `editor_staff`, are configured with different privileges. A trigger enforces that only `editor_staff` can insert into sensitive tables such as DRONE, preventing unauthorized modifications. The frontend interface also reflects this role-based operation design, even if conceptually, by showing which user would have which capabilities.

Overall, the project successfully showcases the integration of frontend development, backend API design, database modeling, advanced SQL concepts, security enforcement, and real-time dashboard visualization. It covers every requirement needed for a complete DBMS full-stack project, including CRUD operations, triggers, functions, procedures, nested queries, aggregates, joins, role-based access, and a fully interactive GUI.
